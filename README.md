Graph Resources
===============

This repository is meant to contain quick to start use cases to help get started with graph, specifically the Gremlin traversal langauge and Tinkerpop frameworks.  These examples will use tinkergraph, the reference graph implementation for Tinkerpop, so that we are not bogged down by implementation specific details.

Getting Started
---------------

First you'll need to download both the gremlin-server and gremlin-console from the [Apache Tinkerpop website](http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org).  Start the gremlin server (using `gremlin-server.sh` in the server's bin directory).  Each use case will assume that you can get into the gremlin console (using `gremlin.sh` in the console's bin directory).

You can go through the [tinkerpop documentation](http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/docs/3.0.2-incubating/)
